# PROJECT DESCRIPTION.
## what are your Akan names.
***Most people dont know their DAY of birth hence reason to get Akan names as they know day of birth in Ghana.***

## Description.
This is a web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name. 

Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. Here are Ghanian day names.

Males👦🏽

Sunday: Kwasi

Monday: Kwadwo

Tuesday: Kwabena

Wednesday: Kwaku

Thursday:  Yaw

Friday: Kofi

Saturday: Kwame

Females👩🏽

Sunday: Akosua

Monday: Adwoa

Tuesday: Abenaa

Wednesday: Akua

Thursday:  Yaa

Friday: Afua

Saturday: Ama

Most people do know when their birthdays are, but some might not know what day of the week they were born. Luckily for us, there are ways to calculate the day of the week from a specific date. This application is built for this USER STORY

 User requests to be able to:

 .Enter my birthday through a form.

 .Choose what gender I am.
