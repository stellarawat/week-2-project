# PROJECT DESCRIPTION
## WHAT IS YOUR AKAN NAMES .
***Most people dont know their DAY of birth hence reason to get Akan names as they know day of birth in Ghana.***

## Description
This is a web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name. 

Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. Here are Ghanian day names.

Friday: Kofi

Saturday: Kwame

Females👩🏽

Monday: Adwoa

Tuesday: Abenaa

Wednesday: Akua

Thursday:  Yaa

Friday: Afua

Saturday: Ama
