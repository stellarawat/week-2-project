              <p class="lead mx-auto m-3"> You probably know the date of your birth. Almost everyone does. But do
                you
                know what <strong><em>day</em></strong>
                of the
                week you were born? Probably not. It's not something that many people bother to remember â€• unless you were born in
                Ghana.
                <br>
                In Ghanian culture, children are often given Akan names, which tell what day they were born. For instance,
                men
                born on a
                Tuesday would be named Kwabena. Women born on a Friday would be named Afua. Check out our full list of
                Akan
                names <a href="names.html">here</a>.<br>
